This basically contains a puppet recipe to ensure that all the needed packages and configs of the system are setup as I need

> [!CAUTION]
Running this script **will** erase your existing configuration, including your sudoers config which may break your system!

To setup the system, you need to run the update.sh script as a super user

```bash
./update.sh
```
